Our goal is to estimate $\theta = (\theta _A, \theta _B)$ by repeating the following procedure five times: randomly choose one of the two coins (with equal probability), and perform ten independent coin tosses with the selected coin. Thus, the entire procedure involves a total of 50 coin tosses'}}{2}}
